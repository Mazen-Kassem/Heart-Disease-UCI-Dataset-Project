# Heart-Disease-UCI-Dataset-Project
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to the **UCI Heart Disease dataset** to predict the presence of heart disease.  
It covers **Data Preprocessing, Dimensionality Reduction (PCA), Feature Selection, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Deployment** of the final trained model.

## Project Overview
- Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (`id=45` from [ucimlrepo](https://pypi.org/project/ucimlrepo/))  
- Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease (`0 = no disease, 1 = disease`).  
- Techniques used:  
  - Data preprocessing & EDA  
  - PCA (dimensionality reduction)  
  - Feature importance & selection (Random Forest, RFE, Chi-Square)  
  - Supervised learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)  
  - Unsupervised learning (KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering)  
  - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)  
  - Model deployment with full pipeline
